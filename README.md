## Intro

Your mission is to build a simplified API to power a listing website.

The `Listing` entity carries a certain number of information about the property (title, market, etc) and has a `Calendar` to carry prices and availability. 

A `Calendar` is just a list of dates with added information about each date - for example each date can have a different price:
```
date=2020-01-01, price=500
date=2020-01-02, price=450
```

Additionally, the concept of a "Base Price". When we predict a price for a day, we think of it as a multiple of the base price. E.g. a price of $150 for a specific day is a 1.5x multiple on the base price of $100.

The challenge will work with a simplified version of the listing and the calendar.


## Your tasks

Endpoints to implement:

(See [Specifications](#specifications) for more details)

 1. Create a listing
   <br>See `POST /listings` endpoint
 
 2. Retrieve a listing
   <br>See `GET /listings/:id` endpoint
 
 3. Update a listing
   <br>See `PUT /listings/:id` endpoint

 4. Delete a listing
   <br>See `DELETE /listings/:id` endpoint
 
 5. Retrieve several listings
   <br>See `GET /listings` endpoint

 6. Retrieve a listing's calendar
   <br>See `GET /listings/:id/calendar` endpoint
 

## Project Layout

- We've set up [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) in `app.py`.
Implement the endpoints in this file. We also added an example to show how to use Flask to process the information of a request.

        

## Specifications

Your solution **must use python 3.7 or greater**.

Your solution **must persist data into a file** without using an ORM library or a DB system.

Your solution **must use [open exchange rates][open-exchange-rates]** to get the exchange rates. The free plan is enough to complete this task.

The response format of your API **must be JSON** and a proper use of HTTP status codes and error handling is expected.

1. `POST /listings` endpoint

   - Send JSON data in the body, for example:
      ```
      {
         "title": "Comfortable Room In Cozy Neighborhood",
         "base_price": 867,
         "currency": "USD",
         "market": "san-francisco",
         "host_name": "John Smith"
      },
      ```
      All fields are required except for `host_name`.

   - Return: the listing information (including its ID) in a JSON format.

2. `GET /listings/:id` endpoint

   - Return: the listing information (including its ID) in a JSON format.
 
3. `PUT /listings/:id` endpoint
   
   - Send JSON data in the body
   - Update only the fields present in the request
   - Return: the listing information (including its ID) in a JSON format.

4. `DELETE /listings/:id` endpoint

   - A successful response must mean a listing was deleted.

5. `GET /listings` endpoint
   
   - Return: a list of listings in a JSON format.

   - This endpoint should allow to filter by market and base price/currency.

      Those filters must be implemented as query parameters: 

      - `market` - optional
         - A single market or a list of markets separated by commas. It uses the market codes.
         - E.g.: `?market=paris` or `?market=paris,san-francisco`
      
      - `base_price.[e|gt|gte|lt|lte]` - optional
         - The comparison type is part of the query parameter.
         - E.g.: `?base_price.gt=500` or `?base_price.lte=300`

      - `currency` - optional but required when base price is specified
         - It uses the currency codes.
         - E.g.: `?currency=usd`


1. `GET /listings/:id/calendar` endpoint

   - This endpoint returns the listing's calendar (365 days starting from today).
  
   - It must allow to return the calendar in any currency. The default being the listing's currency.
   
      This parameter must be implemented as a query parameter:

      - `currency` - optional
         - It uses the currency codes.
         - E.g.: `?currency=usd`

   - Format for dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Calendar rules:
        - For the Paris and Lisbon markets: Saturday and Sunday => 1.5x of base price
        - For the San Francisco market: Wednesday => 0.70x of base price
        - For the rest of the markets: Friday => 1.25x of base price
   - Example of response:  
   ```
   [
      {
         "date": "2019-01-01",
         "price": 500,
         "currency": "USD",
      },
      {
         "date": "2019-01-02",
         "price": 550,
         "currency": "USD",
      },
      ...
   ]
   ```
